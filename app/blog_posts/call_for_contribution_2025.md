The Regulated Plants Database, hosted by the [United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH)](https://unu.edu/inweh), is at a pivotal moment. Having successfully launched with comprehensive coverage of over 1,000 regulated invasive plant species across Australia, Canada, and the United States, we are now expanding our mission globally. We need your expertise, data, and collaboration to build the world's most comprehensive resource for invasive plant regulations.

### Why Your Contribution Matters

Invasive plants cost global economies billions of dollars annually and represent one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide. The fragmented nature of regulations across jurisdictions creates confusion for researchers, land managers, policymakers, and agricultural professionals who require clear and accessible information to make informed decisions.
This database serves as a vital bridge, consolidating official regulatory lists into a single, searchable platform that enables users to:

- Track **regulatory trends** across regions
- Identify plants of concern for agricultural planning
- Develop informed **regulation strategies**
- Make responsible **land management decisions**
- Support **educational initiatives** on invasive species management

We seek partnerships with federal, state, provincial, and national agencies responsible for regulating plants, ensuring biosecurity, and conserving biodiversity. Your official lists, taxonomic databases, and regulatory updates are the foundation of our accuracy and comprehensiveness.

**We seek contributions to current regulated plant lists and updates to existing regulations.**

Ready to contribute to this vital global resource? Simply reach out via the website's contact form. We will respond swiftly to understand and incorporate your source, and if needed, develop a data sharing agreement that meets your organization's requirements.
