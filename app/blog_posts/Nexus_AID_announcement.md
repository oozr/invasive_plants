### United Nations University’s Sustainability Nexus Analytics, Informatics, and Data (AID) Programme

We are delighted to announce that the Regulated Weeds Database has been recognised by the [United Nations University’s Sustainability Nexus Analytics, Informatics, and Data (AID) Programme](https://www.sustainabilityaid.net) and is now featured in their esteemed AID Tools list. The AID Programme is dedicated to identifying and promoting information, data, computational techniques, and analytical tools that facilitate global sustainable management of resources such as water, soil, waste, energy, and geo resources. 


Our inclusion in this list underscores the significance of our work in providing comprehensive information on regulated weed species across the United States. The Regulated Weeds Database serves as a vital resource for researchers, agricultural professionals, and the public, offering easy access to information about which weeds are regulated in different states.

By compiling data from state authorities, we have created an interactive map and searchable database that enhances understanding and management of regulated weed species. This recognition by the AID Programme not only validates our efforts but also amplifies our reach, enabling a broader audience to benefit from our data.

We remain committed to providing accurate and up-to-date information to support sustainable agricultural practices and environmental stewardship.

Together, we can contribute to more informed decision-making and effective management of regulated weed species, promoting sustainability and ecological balance.
