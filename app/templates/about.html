    <h2>What is the Regulated Weeds Database?</h2>
    <p>The Regulated Weeds Database is a comprehensive resource that tracks and displays information about regulated weed species across different U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and Australia. Our goal is to provide researchers, agricultural professionals, and the public with easy access to information about which weeds are regulated in different jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>This project compiles data from governmental agricultural authorities to create an interactive map and searchable database of regulated weed species.</p>
