                   <p>
                       The Regulated Weeds Database is a comprehensive resource that tracks and displays information about regulated weed species across different U.S. states. Our goal is to provide researchers, agricultural professionals, and the public with easy access to information about which weeds are regulated in different states.

                       This project compiles data from state agricultural authorities to create an interactive map and searchable database of regulated weed species.
