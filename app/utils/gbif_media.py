"""Display-ready plant photographs sourced from GBIF occurrence media.

The public surface is one function::

    fetch_species_photos(usage_key, base_url=..., timeout_seconds=..., limit=...)
        -> list of {"thumbnail_url", "full_url", "creator", "licence", "licence_url",
                    "occurrence_url", "publisher"}

Everything else -- the taxon-key/occurrence-key distinction, the MD5 image-cache URL
scheme, licence normalisation, de-duplication and caching -- is hidden behind it.

Why two GBIF calls' worth of machinery for one image:

  Our database stores ``plants.gbif_usage_key``, which is a GBIF *backbone taxon key*
  (the ``usageKey`` returned by GBIF's species-match API). GBIF's image cache is keyed
  by *occurrence* key -- an individual observation record -- not by taxon. So we first
  ask the occurrence search API which observations of this taxon carry photographs,
  then build a cache URL per photograph:

      https://api.gbif.org/v1/image/cache/<thumbor-args>/occurrence/<occurrenceKey>/media/<md5(identifier)>

  where ``identifier`` is the original media URL from the occurrence record and the MD5
  is hex-encoded. The image cache runs Thumbor, so resizing/cropping is expressed as
  leading path segments (``480x480`` crops to a square, ``fit-in/1600x1600`` letterboxes).
  Serving through the cache rather than hot-linking the source means we get GBIF's CDN,
  consistent sizing, and no traffic sent to individual herbaria or S3 buckets.

Weeds are photogenic in inconsistent ways -- one canonical image rarely exists, and a
herbarium sheet looks nothing like a live plant -- so callers get a small ranked set
rather than a single "best" photo.
